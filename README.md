## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface designed to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently. The goal is to provide a secure and user-friendly admin dashboard for administrators to assign roles, define permissions, and manage user access dynamically.

## Project Overview

The RBAC UI is designed to help administrators manage users, roles, and permissions, offering functionalities to:


- create, edit, and delete users

- Assign roles and permissions dynamically to users
  
- Search and filter users

## Features

1. ### Dashboard:

View a comprehensive overview of users and their roles in the system.


2. ### Manage Users:

Add, edit, and delete users while managing their status (Active/Inactive).


3. ### Manage Roles:


Define new roles, edit existing roles, and delete roles as necessary.


4. ### Manage Permissions:


Assign and modify permissions for roles dynamically.


5. ### Search and Filter:

Search for users based on their name or email and filter them as needed.



## Technology Stack

- React.js for building the user interface.
- React Router for managing routing across different pages.
- Styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling.
- Context API to manage global state (e.g. theme management).


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
